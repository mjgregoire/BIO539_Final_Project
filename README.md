# Final_Project_BIO539

This project includes a pipeline for RNA seq data analysis from the SRA file raw reads stage to differential gene expression and principal component analysis in R. 
The main software used in this pipeline are linux codes on the HPC, SRA toolkit, Fastqc, STAR, Stringtie, bash, python, R ->Deseq2, ggplot, tidyverse.
